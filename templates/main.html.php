            <h2>The Computer Science Handbook</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Have you ever had trouble searching for a compiled library of the most common computer science algorithms?
                Maybe it was to supplement material taught in a programming course. Maybe it was to prepare for a
                programming contest or a technical interview. Or maybe you were just nerdy and awesome enough to want to
                learn about some CS algorithms in your free time. If any of that sounds like you, then welcome to The
                CS Handbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CS Handbook is an on-going project started by two computer science students from the University of
                Waterloo. It's a collection of computer science algorithms that ranges from simple calculations such as the
                GCD, to the perplexing calculations behind Shortest Path Problems. It's a place for quick reference and
                intensive learning for both beginnings and experts alike.
            </p>

            <p> Again, welcome and enjoy your stay!</p>
