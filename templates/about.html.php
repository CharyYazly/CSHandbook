            <h2>The Computer Science Handbook</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                There are many existing resources for computer science algorithms and data structures but they all use complex 
                terminology and often they are difficult to understand. For example, Wikipedia has many articles on different
                algorithms but they are full of abstract explainations and the articles are not organized so that they can be
                searched easily. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Computer Science Handbook is an on-going project started by two computer science students from the University of
                Waterloo to help others people understand the principles of computer science in a very understandable fashion.
                We have organized articles on some essential algorithms and data structures such that it is easy to navigate.
                We strive to make explainations as simple as possible so anyone without a math/programming 
                background can understand.
                We have also made the web page as easy to navigate as possible so it is as simple as clicking another link to get to
                another page. 
                We provide exercises at the bottom of every article to help you understand the information better.
            </p>

                Whether you are a curious student starting to dive into the world of computer science or a job candidate looking
                for interview help, we hope that we can help! We only ask one thing of you: you must learn something
                before you leave this site!
