## Introduction

Trees are data structures that follow a hierarchy, each node has exactly one or zero parents and each node has children. Trees are recursive structures meaning that each child of a tree is also a tree. A tree within another tree is called a **subtree**.

A **child** is a node that is below another node. 

A **parent** is a node that is above another node.

The element at the top of the tree with no parents is called a **root**. The node at the bottom of the tree with no children is called a **leaf**.

Each node can hold different kinds of information depending on the tree. A node can hold the children it has, the parent it has, a key associated with the node and a value associated with the node.

* A is the root of the tree and E,F,G,H are leaves. 
* The parent of E is B. 
* C,F,G is a subtree of the original tree.

## [[Binary Tree]]

A binary tree is a tree where every node has at max two children.
