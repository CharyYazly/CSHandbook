## Introduction

An adjacency list stores a graph in an array of [[linked lists|Linked Lists]]. Each node stores its neighbours by keeping a linked list of edges. Adjacency lists are slower when checking if an edge exists but they are more memory efficient since they only need to store the total number of edges.
