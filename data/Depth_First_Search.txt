A depth first search is a transversal of a tree that goes as far down as a branch as possible and then back.

A DFS can also be used on a graph to transverse it by ignoring nodes that have already been visited.

A DFS requires a stack but most the time DFS uses recursion which uses the system stack.

## Implementation

Most of the time, DFS is implemented using recursion and it is very short and simple to code.

### Binary Tree Transversal

This is a DFS implementation for a binary tree

[[[[
public class Tree {
	int value;
	Tree left;
	Tree right;
}

/**
 * Performs a DFS on a binary tree
 * tree - current tree DFS is at
 */
public static void DFS(Tree cur){
	if(cur==null)return;
	DFS(cur.left);
	System.out.println(cur.value);
	DFS(cur.right);
}
]]]]

### Graph Transversal

This is a DFS implementation for transversing a bidirectional graph with positive weights.

[[[[
/**
 * Performs a DFS on a graph
 * adjMatrix - Adjacency matrix for a graph with positive edges. 0 indicates no edge.
 * cur - Current node the DFS is at
 * visited - Mutable array which keeps track of which nodes have been visited already
 */
public static void DFS_graph(int[][] adjMatrix,int cur,boolean[] visited){
	if(visited[cur])return;
	visited[cur] = true;
	System.out.println(cur);
	for(int i=0;i<adjMatrix.length;i++){
		if(adjMatrix[cur][i]>0)DFS_graph(adjMatrix,i,visited);
	}
	return;
}

]]]]

## Exercises

1. Given a tree, find the height (the longest path from root to leaf)
2. Given a graph, determine if it contains a cycle
3. Given a graph, determine the number of [[strongly connected components|Strongly Connected Compontents]]
4. Given a grid of squares with walls at certain locations and two locations A and B, find the minimum distance (going up/left/right/down) between the locations or impossible otherwise. For example if A is at (1,1) and B is at (3,1) but there is a wall at (2,1) then the minimum distance would be 4 (down, left, left, up).
