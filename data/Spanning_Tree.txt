## Introduction

A spanning tree of a graph is a connected tree that spans all the nodes of the graph.

A [[minimum spanning tree|Minimum Spanning Tree]] is the spanning tree that requires the minimum of some property such as total weight or total edges.

Spanning tree algorithms are essential in networking to ensure no loops occur when sending data through a network.
