## Introduction

Advanced data structures are data structures are very specific in performing a single task and they usually require more time to implement.

## Trees

### [[B tree]]

### [[Binary Indexed Tree]]

### [[AVL Tree]]

### [[Red Black Tree]]

### [[Segment Tree]]

### [[Interval Tree]]

### [[Splay Tree]]

## [[Heap]]

### [[Fibonacci Heap]]

### [[Binomial Heap]]

## [[Trie]]

A trie is tree which stores strings by their prefixes. A trie can replace a set for storing strings as it is faster than a hash set and it can the stored strings sorted but it takes more memory.

Let m be the length of the string.
