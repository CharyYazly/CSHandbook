### 1D intersection of line segments

Given a list of line segments in 1D, find the area of overlap. For example: (1,5), (6, 7), (2, 6). The area of overlap is 3 since (1,5) overlaps with (2,6) at (2,5) so the area is 3.

Every line segment has a starting point and ending point. Let the starting point will be the smaller coordinate and the ending point be the larger coordinate. We can then put all these points in a priority queue

When we reach a starting point we will increase a counter and when we reach an ending point we will decrease the counter. When the counter is > 0 then we can add the distance between points to the total length.
