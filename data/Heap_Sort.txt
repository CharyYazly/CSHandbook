## Introduction

*Prerequisites*: [[Heap]]

Heap sort is a sort that inserts all the element in an array into a min heap and then pops all the element outs. Since a heap guarantees that the root node will be the smallest element, we can store the entire array in a heap and the order that they are popped out of the heap will be in order.

### Implementation

[[[[
public void heapSort(int[] arr) {
  // Use a built-in heap.
  PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();

  // Add all elements into heap.
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    pq.add(arr[i]);
  }
  // Pop all elements from heap.
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    arr[i] = pq.poll();
  }
}
]]]]
