## Introduction

Bubble sort is one of the most basic sorting algorithms, one of the first you should learn. 

Its name describes how the algorithm works: bigger bubbles float to the top. This will become more clear when we see the implmentation.

The sorting algorithms are implemented to sort integer arrays but can be adapted to sort arrays of any data structure that is comparable. 

## Implementation

[[[[
//sorts integers from smallest to greatest
public static void BubbleSort (int a[]){
	for (int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
		for (int j=1;j<a.length;j++){
			//if the current bubble is smaller than the bubble that's 
			//below then the bigger bubble floats up
			if (a[j]<a[j-1]){
				//swap the bubbles
				int temp = a[j];
				a[j] = a[j-1];
				a[j-1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
}
