## Introduction

Bubble sort is one of the most basic sorting algorithms, one of the first you should learn. 

Its name describes how the algorithm works: bigger bubbles float to the top. Each time we pass through the array, we swap adjacent bigger elements with smaller elements. If we do this and we do not swap any adjacent elements in a pass, then we know we have sorted the array. It can be proved that you will need to pass through the array at most N times. Try to prove this for yourself.

## Implementation

Given an array, sort it from smallest to biggest.

[[[[
public static void BubbleSort(int array[]) {
  // Iterate through each node
  boolean swapped = true;
  while (swapped) {
    swapped = false;
    // Iterate through each next node
    for (int j = 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      // Swap if current element is bigger then next
      if (array[j - 1] > array[j]) {
        // swap the bubbles
        int temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j - 1];
        array[j - 1] = temp;
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
