## Introduction

Insertion Sort is the another n<sup>2</sup> sorting algorithm.

It works by starting with an empty sorted sequence of numbers and then inserting every element in the array into the sorted sequence maintaining the order after each insert.

The sorting algorithms are implemented to sort integer arrays but can be adapted to sort arrays of any data structure that is comparable. 

## Implementation


[[[[
//sorts integers from smallest to greatest
public static void InsertionSort (int a[]){
	//iterates through the array selecting the smallest elements
	for (int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
		//element that needs to be inserted into the sorted list
		int val = a[i]; 
		//keeps track of where to insert the element
		int index = i; 
		
		//loops through the already sorted list to find where to 
		//insert the current element
		while (index > 0 && a[index-1] > val){
			//switches the current item at index with the one before 
			//to check if the element that needs to be inserted will 
			//go in the next spot
			a[index] = a[index-1];
			index--;
		}
		a[index] = val;
	}
}
