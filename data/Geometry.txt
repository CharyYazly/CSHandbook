## Convex Hull

A convex hull is the set of points which creates an outer polygon that encompasses the other points in the set.

Let n be number of points in set and h be number of points on convex hull.

##Area of polygon

To find the area of a polygon given a set of points, we can use the shoelace formula. 

[[[[{lang-html}
Area = 0.5 * (x_1*y_2 + x_2*y_3+ .... + x_n-1*y_n + x_n*y_1 - x_2*y_1 - x_3*y_2 - ... - x_n*y_n-1 - x_1*y_n)
]]]]


##Point Test

To test if a point is in a polygon, we take a random outside of the polygon and draw a line from that point to the testing point. On the line we count the number of times it crosses a line segment from the polygon and if it is even, then the point is not in the polygon and if it is odd, then the point is inside the polygon.

## [[Line Sweeping]]

Line sweeping is a form of search that iterates a line from left to right which stops at specific points. 

[[[[

void lineSweep(points){
   PriorityQueue pq = new PriorityQueue(points);
   int sum = 0;
   while(pq.empty()==false){
        sum += operation(pq.pop);
   }
   return sum;
}
