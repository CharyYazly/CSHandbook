##Introduction

Sets are data structures that stores values and are used for testing if an element already exists within the set.  Sets generally have three operations: insertion, deletion and membership test. 

**Membership** test is checking whether an element exists within the set. Insertion places an element into the set and deletion removes an element from the set.

## Types

Type | Operation | Membership | Insertion | Deletion
-|-
[[Tree Set]] | Time Complexity | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n)
[[Hash Set]] | Time Complexity | O(1) | O(1) | O(1)

## Exercises

1. Given a list of words, determine how many of them are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word that can have its letters scrambled into another word. 
  * For example silent and listen are anagrams but banana and orange are not.
2. Given two lists of friends, find the number of mutual friends.
3. Given a list of numbers, find the number of tuples of size 4 that add to 0. 
  * For example in the list (10,5,-1, 3, 4, -6) the tuple of size 4 (-1,3,4-6) adds to 0.
