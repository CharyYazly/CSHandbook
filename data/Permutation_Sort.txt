## Introduction

Permutation sort is a sort that keeps permuting the array until it is sorted. It is the slowest sort that will guarantee that the array will be sorted.

## Implementation

We keep finding the next permutation until the array is sorted.

### Code

[[[[
void permuteSort(int[] arr){
  while(!sorted(arr)){
    permute(arr);
  }
}
]]]]
