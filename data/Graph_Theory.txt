## Introduction

Graphs are a set of objects where some pairs of objects  **nodes** are usually connected by links **edges**. The nodes here can be seen numbered from 1 to 6. There are edges connecting these various nodes. The graph here can be seen as an undirected graph. That means that this graph can go from 4 to 5 and back to 4 from 5. The movements can be bidirectional and there is no particular direction that must be used. However in a directed graph (as seen below) there is a particular direction that must be followed. 

A **subgraph** is a subset of edges and vertices within a graph.

A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a graph with no directed cycles (see topological sorting). 

A **weighted** graph is a graph that contains weights or values assigned to each edge or node. Usually these weights act as the cost to reach/use that node.



## Representations

A graph can be represented as a adjacency matrix or a adjacency list.



### Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency matrixes use a matrix to store the edges between nodes. A 1 means a connection between x and y and a 0 means no connection. The edge weight could also be used instead of a 1. O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes. For example the matrix for graph below is:


  |1|2|3|4|5|6
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
 3 |0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |1
 5 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0




### Adjacency List

Adjacency lists use an array of [[Linked Lists|linked lists]] to store all the edges. At x, you have a linked list (or use arraylist) of number that point to the connect node. 1 connect to nodes 2 and 5, 2 connects to 1, 3 and 5 and so forth. O(m) storage where m is number of edges.

Node | edges
---|-----
 1 | 2, 5
2 | 1 3 5
3 | 2 4
4 | 3 5 6
5 | 1 2 4
6 |4



##Tree

A tree is a special graph with n-1 edges with n nodes. It has the special property that there will be only one path from one node to another node. Trees follow a recursive structure such that each child of a tree is a tree as well.

A **subtree** is a child tree of a tree.


[==============================]
###Spanning Tree

A spanning tree of a graph is a tree that spans all the nodes of the graph but only using some of the edges to connect all the nodes. 

A [[Minimum Spanning Tree]] is the spanning tree that requires the minimum of some property such as total weight or total edges.

Spanning tree algorithms are essential in networking to ensure no loops occur when sending data through a network.


| Algorithm | Desc | Time | Space
|-
|[[Prim's]] | Using greedy method | O(n log n) | O(n^^2^^)
|[[Kruskal]] | Using connected componenets| O(n log n) | O(n^^2^^)


##Shortest Path

The shortest path is defined as a path from one node to another while trying to minimize a certain property (least number of nodes, smallest total weight). However, shortest paths may have negative weights leads to cycles. 



###Algorithms


| Algorithm | Desc | Time | Space | Detect cycles?
|----------|----|------|-----|----------
|[[Floyd Warshall]] | Computes shortest path between all pairs of nodes | O(n^^3^^) | O(n^^2^^) | Yes
|[[Bellman Ford]] | Computes shortest path between a pairs of nodes | O(n^^2^^) | O(n) | Yes
|[[Dijkstra's]] | Computes shortest path between a pair of nodes using the Greedy method | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | No


##Travelling Salesman Problem

The [[Travelling salesman]] is the problem where a salesman wants to visit all nodes in path while minimizing the total cost of weights used of edges.

##[[Connected Components]]

A connected component is a subgraph where all the vertices in the subgraph connect to each other. Finding the number of distinct connected components can be done using a [[breadth first search|Breadth First Search]] or a [[depth first search|Depth First Search]]. 


###[[Strongly Connected Components]]

A strongly connected component is a connected component but has the property that each vertex can visit any other vertex in the strongly connected component from any path. For bidirectional graphs, this is just the connected component but it is different for directed graphs.
