## Introduction

Dijkstra's is a greedy approach to find the shortest path. It has many useful applications in networking and it can be extended to a variety of problems.

Dijkstra works by beginning at the starting node repeatedly picking the next closest node of those already visited.

If Dijkstra's is implemented using a priority queue, the run time is O(n log n). 

If a negative cycle exists within the graph, then the algorithm breaks as it will repeatedly try to take the negative edges. See [[Bellman Ford]] to find negative cycles in a graph. 

A naive fix for negative cycles would be to offset all edges by the largest negative edge and then subtract it from the resulting total but this does not work. Consider an example where you have start node A and end node B. The first route from A->B has length 2 and the second route has lengths 1,1,-2. Clearly the second route has less cost. If we try to make the length positive by adding all costs by 2, we will have the first path of length 4 and the second path of lengths 3,3,0 and the first route becomes the smallest total cost which is wrong.

* [[Priority Queue]]
* [[Shortest Path]]

## Implementation

At each node we visit we keep track of the minimum cost it takes to reach to reach that node from the starting node. 

1. Start at the starting node
2. Find an unvisited node that has the least cost to reach from the visited nodes.
3. Mark that node as visited
4. Repeat until all nodes are visited

When we reach a node for the first time, it will be the shortest path to that node (Try to prove this to yourself).

We first start at the starting node. The distance from the starting node to the starting node is obviously 0.

From the starting node we have two nodes we can reach. The top node has a cost of 3 to reach and the bottom node has a cost of 5 to reach.

We pick the smallest node the reach and we mark it as visited. Once we visit a node, we can guarantee that it is the smallest cost to reach it. The next nodes minimum cost to reach is 10, 5 and 5.

We are indifferent to both 5's as they are both the minimum and we can choose either. We mark the node as visited and we find the minimum costs to other nodes which are 5,10,11.

{{djikstra3.png}}

We take the next smallest which is 5 and we mark the node as visited. The next costs are 10 and 11. 

{{djikstra4.png}}

We take the smallest which is 10 and we now only have one last node to reach at a cost of 11.

At each node we have the minimum cost to get from the start node to each node.

### Java
Implementation of Dijkstra in Java using a [[priority queue|Priority Queue]].

[[[[
class node implements Comparable<node>{
	int weight,index;
	public node(int weight,int index){
		this.weight = weight;
		this.index = index;
	}
	public int compareTo(node e){
		return weight-e.weight;
	}
}

public static int dijkstra(int[][] adjMatrix,int start,int end){
	int n = adjMatrix.length;
	PriorityQueue <node> pq = new PriorityQueue<node>();
	boolean visited[] = new boolean[n];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)visited[i] = false;
	pq.add(new node(0,start));
	while(!visited[end] && !pq.isEmpty()){
		node curNode = pq.poll();
	
		if(visited[curNode.index])continue;
		visited[curNode.index] = true;
		if(curNode.index==end){
			return curNode.weight;
		}
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			if(adjMatrix[curNode.index][i]>0 && !visited[i]){
				int newWeight = curNode.weight+adjMatrix[curNode.index][i];
				pq.add(new node(newWeight,i));
			}
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
]]]]

## Applications

In general, Dijkstra is usually the goto method for finding the minimum cost between two nodes in any kind of network. For example, Dijkstra can be used in networking to find the shortest path between two hosts. It can also be used in flight networking to find the cheapest cost to get from one airport to another airport. 

## Practice Exercises

1. Extend Dijkstra's to find the exact path from start to end (the order of nodes of the shortest path A->B->C)
2. Extend Dijkstra's to find the best three minimal costs with unique paths from the start node to the end node
3. Prove that Dijkstra's algorithm works
