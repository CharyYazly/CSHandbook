## Introduction

There are some fundamental topics about writing computer programs that we must learn before we can move on to the basic theory.

## [[Basics]]

First we must learn how to write a basic Java program with control structures and variables.

## [[Runtime and Memory]]

Next, we analyze how long a program will take to perform a calculation and how much memory a program will used based on the inputs.

## [[Boolean Algebra]]

## [[Logic]]
