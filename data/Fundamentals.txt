## Introduction

There are some fundamental topics about writing computer programs that we must learn before we can move on to the basic theory.

### [[Control Structures]]

If statement:

[[[[
if (expression){
  do action;
}
]]]]

Loops:
[[[[
while(expression){
  do action;
}
]]]]

## Advanced Control Structures

### [[Arrays]]

Arrays are lists of the same data type.

### [[Functions]]

Functions are reusable pieces of code.

## [[Runtime and Memory]]

Programs requires memory to store data and takes computation time to run. If we have different programs that do the same function, we want to be able to compare how efficient they are.
